# üìã ShareDo Platform - Complete Review Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Review Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

## üö® Critical Issues

### 1. **Source Code Not Cleaned Up**
**SEVERITY: HIGH**

All packages still contain the ENTIRE CLI codebase in their `src/` folders:
- ‚ùå **@sharedo/core** has CLI commands, workflows, file operations (should ONLY have auth)
- ‚ùå **@sharedo/business** has auth, CLI commands (should ONLY have business logic)
- ‚ùå **@sharedo/platform-adapter** has everything (should ONLY have interfaces)
- ‚ùå **@sharedo/cli** has correct code but needs refactoring
- ‚ùå **@sharedo/vscode** has CLI code (should be VS Code extension)
- ‚ùå **@sharedo/mcp** has CLI code (should be MCP server)

### Current State vs. Expected State

| Package | Current State | Expected State | Action Needed |
|---------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **@sharedo/core** | Full CLI codebase | Only auth + API clients | Remove 90% of files |
| **@sharedo/business** | Full CLI codebase | Only business logic | Remove 80% of files |
| **@sharedo/platform-adapter** | Full CLI codebase + index.ts | Only interfaces | Remove ALL except index.ts |
| **@sharedo/cli** | Full CLI codebase | CLI commands | Refactor to use shared |
| **@sharedo/vscode** | Full CLI codebase + index.ts | VS Code extension | Remove all, start fresh |
| **@sharedo/mcp** | Full CLI codebase + index.ts | MCP server | Remove all, start fresh |

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. **Package Configuration**
- ‚úÖ All `package.json` files have correct names
- ‚úÖ Dependencies are properly configured
- ‚úÖ TypeScript configs are in place
- ‚úÖ Build scripts are ready

### 2. **CLAUDE.md Instructions**
- ‚úÖ Clear reset notice in each file
- ‚úÖ Detailed scope definitions
- ‚úÖ Code examples provided
- ‚úÖ Dependencies explained
- ‚úÖ Development tasks outlined

### 3. **Infrastructure**
- ‚úÖ NPM workspaces configured
- ‚úÖ Lerna setup (though v8, not v7)
- ‚úÖ Auto-approve permissions
- ‚úÖ Git worktrees created

## üìä Package Review Details

### @sharedo/core
**CLAUDE.md**: ‚úÖ Excellent - Clear instructions, good examples  
**Package.json**: ‚úÖ Correct name and dependencies  
**Source Code**: ‚ùå Contains entire CLI - needs major cleanup  
**Priority**: HIGH - Foundation package, others depend on it

**What AI Should Do First:**
1. Delete everything except:
   - `server/authenticate.ts`
   - `server/sharedoClient.ts`
   - `config/*`
   - `enums.ts`
2. Create clean `src/index.ts`
3. Build authentication service

### @sharedo/business
**CLAUDE.md**: ‚úÖ Good instructions and service examples  
**Package.json**: ‚úÖ Correct dependencies on core  
**Source Code**: ‚ùå Contains entire CLI - needs cleanup  
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical business logic layer

**What AI Should Do First:**
1. Delete all except `Request/*` folders
2. Remove auth/config/CLI files
3. Refactor into service classes
4. Create clean exports

### @sharedo/platform-adapter
**CLAUDE.md**: ‚úÖ Excellent interface definitions  
**Package.json**: ‚úÖ Minimal and correct  
**Source Code**: ‚ùå Has CLI code, only needs interfaces  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Important but simple

**What AI Should Do First:**
1. Delete EVERYTHING except `index.ts`
2. Create interface files as shown in CLAUDE.md
3. No implementations, only contracts

### @sharedo/cli
**CLAUDE.md**: ‚úÖ Good refactoring instructions  
**Package.json**: ‚úÖ Has all CLI dependencies  
**Source Code**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Has right code but needs refactoring  
**Priority**: LOW - Wait for core/business first

**What AI Should Do:**
1. Wait for core/business packages
2. Refactor to use shared packages
3. Remove duplicate business logic
4. Implement IPlatform

### @sharedo/vscode
**CLAUDE.md**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive VS Code examples  
**Package.json**: ‚úÖ VS Code configured  
**Source Code**: ‚ùå Has CLI code instead of extension  
**Priority**: LOW - Platform implementation

**What AI Should Do First:**
1. Delete ALL src files except index.ts
2. Start fresh with extension.ts
3. Build VS Code specific features

### @sharedo/mcp
**CLAUDE.md**: ‚úÖ Good MCP server examples  
**Package.json**: ‚úÖ Has MCP SDK dependency  
**Source Code**: ‚ùå Has CLI code instead of MCP  
**Priority**: LOW - Platform implementation

**What AI Should Do First:**
1. Delete ALL src files except index.ts
2. Implement MCP protocol
3. Expose ShareDo as tools

## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Do First!)

1. **Clean Up Source Folders**
   ```bash
   # For @sharedo/core - Keep only auth/config
   # For @sharedo/business - Keep only Request folders
   # For @sharedo/platform-adapter - Keep only index.ts
   # For @sharedo/vscode - Keep only index.ts
   # For @sharedo/mcp - Keep only index.ts
   ```

2. **Build Order**
   1. Core first (auth + API)
   2. Platform-adapter (interfaces)
   3. Business (services)
   4. Then platforms (CLI/VS Code/MCP)

### What Each AI Must Know

**CRITICAL**: Your `src/` folder currently has the wrong code! 
- Don't be confused by existing files
- Follow your CLAUDE.md instructions
- Delete/ignore files not in your scope
- Start fresh with clean structure

## üìà Success Metrics

A successful implementation will have:
- **@sharedo/core**: ~10 files (auth, API, config)
- **@sharedo/business**: ~20 files (services, interfaces)
- **@sharedo/platform-adapter**: ~5 files (interfaces only)
- **@sharedo/cli**: ~15 files (commands, platform impl)
- **@sharedo/vscode**: ~10 files (extension, providers)
- **@sharedo/mcp**: ~5 files (server, tools)

Currently: Each has 50+ files (all wrong!)

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Option A**: Create cleanup script to remove wrong files
2. **Option B**: Each AI cleans their own package first
3. **Option C**: Start with empty src folders

**Recommendation**: Option A - Automated cleanup before AIs start

**Review Complete**: The plans are good, but implementation needs source cleanup first!
