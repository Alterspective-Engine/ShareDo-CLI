## ðŸš« Never Do This
- Work on main branch
- Use `git add .`
- Commit without testing
- Import from packages that depend on you
- Implement business logic outside business package

## âœ… Always Do This
- Create feature branches
- Commit frequently
- Test before committing
- Push at end of session
- Read your CLAUDE.md file
