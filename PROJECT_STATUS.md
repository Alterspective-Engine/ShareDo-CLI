# ShareDo Platform - Master Project Status

**Date**: 2025-08-30
**Status**: Week 1 Foundation Complete - Business Logic Ready to Start

## 🚨 What Happened

The initial setup got confused - the AI copied the entire CLI codebase into every worktree. This has now been **completely fixed**. Each package now has:
- ✅ Correct package name and purpose
- ✅ Proper dependencies configured
- ✅ Clear CLAUDE.md instructions
- ✅ Fresh start with proper architecture

## 📦 Package Overview

| Package | Name | Status | Purpose |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| **core** | `@sharedo/core` | ✅ Complete | Authentication, API clients, shared models |
| **business** | `@sharedo/business` | 🟡 Ready to Start | Workflows, files, templates business logic |
| **platform-adapter** | `@sharedo/platform-adapter` | ✅ Complete | Platform abstraction interfaces |
| **cli** | `@sharedo/cli` | ⏸️ Waiting | Command-line interface |
| **vscode** | `@sharedo/vscode` | ⏸️ Waiting | VS Code extension |
| **mcp** | `@sharedo/mcp` | ⏸️ Waiting | MCP server for AI integration |

## 🚀 How to Start Each AI

All commands run from the main directory (`C:\Users\IgorJericevich\Documents\GitHub\SharedoCLI`):

```bash
# Core Package (Start First!)
npm run claude:core

# Business Logic (Start Second)
npm run claude:business

# Platform Adapter (Can start anytime)
npm run claude:platform-adapter

# Platform Implementations (Start after core & business)
npm run claude:cli
npm run claude:vscode
npm run claude:mcp
```

## 📋 Each Package Has

### ✅ Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Correct name and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `README.md` - Package documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI developer instructions
- `.claude_config.json` - Auto-approve permissions

### ✅ Source Structure
```

2. **@sharedo/platform-adapter** - ✅ All interfaces defined

### Phase 2: Business Logic 🚀 CURRENT
3. **@sharedo/business** - Ready to implement workflows, files, templates

### Phase 3: Platform Implementations ⏸️ WAITING
4. **@sharedo/cli** - Waiting for business logic
5. **@sharedo/vscode** - Waiting for business logic
6. **@sharedo/mcp** - Waiting for business logic

## 🏗️ Build Commands

From main directory:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Packages are linked** - Changes in one are immediately available to others
2. **Build order matters** - Core → Business → Platforms
3. **80% code sharing** - Don't duplicate logic!
4. **Each AI has clear scope** - Check CLAUDE.md in each worktree

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- ✅ All worktrees created
- ✅ All package.json files corrected
- ✅ All CLAUDE.md files created with clear instructions
- ✅ Dependencies properly configured
- ✅ NPM scripts for all claude commands
- ✅ Auto-approve permissions configured
- ✅ Packages properly linked with npm workspaces

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

The project is now properly structured. Each AI can start fresh with:
1. Clear understanding of their package's purpose
2. Proper dependencies configured
3. No confusion about what code belongs where
4. Shared packages for 80% code reuse

Start with `npm run claude:core` and build the foundation!
